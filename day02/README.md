# JavaScript Essentials

This document briefly outlines fundamental concepts in JavaScript, including operators, control flow statements, strings, arrays, and functions. Each concept is defined with a succinct explanation.

## Operators

JavaScript operators are symbols used to perform operations on operands.

- *Arithmetic Operators*: Perform arithmetic on numbers (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- *Comparison Operators*: Compare two values and return a boolean (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
- *Logical Operators*: Used to determine the logic between variables or values (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- *Assignment Operators*: Assign values to JavaScript variables (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`).

## Conditional Statements

Control the flow of code based on conditions.

- *if statement*: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- *else statement*: Executes a block of code if the same condition is false.
- *else if statement*: Specifies a new condition to test if the first condition is false.
- *switch statement*: Specifies many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

## Looping Statements

Execute a block of code a number of times.

- *for loop*: Loops through a block of code a number of times.
- *while loop*: Loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- *do...while loop*: Also loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true, but executes the code block once before checking the condition.
- *for...in loop*: Loops through the properties of an object.
- *for...of loop*: Loops over iterable objects (like Arrays, Strings).

## String and Its Methods

Represents a sequence of characters.

- Methods include `.length`, `.charAt()`, `.indexOf()`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.toLowerCase()`, `.substring()`, `.slice()`, `.split()`, `.replace()`, and more.

## Arrays and Their Methods

Used to store multiple values in a single variable.

- Methods include `.length`, `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, `.indexOf()`, `.splice()`, `.slice()`, `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, and more.

## Functions and Their Types

Blocks of code designed to perform a particular task.

- *Function Declaration*: Declares a function with the specified parameters.
- *Function Expression*: A function defined inside an expression.
- *Arrow Function*: Shorter syntax for writing function expressions.
- *IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)*: A function that runs as soon as it is defined.
- *Callback Function*: A function passed into another function as an argument.
